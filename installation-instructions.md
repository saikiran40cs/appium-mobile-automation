# Installing Appium {#installing-appium}

Continuing from the last chapter, which was more to explain what Appium is about and the explanation of architecture. This chapter will detail how to write your first test and execute that.

Before installing Appium, you need to get few other things in ecosystem:

* Android Studio or Android SDK
* Install Appium
* IDE of your choice \(Eclipse or IntelliJ IDea\)

I am assuming that **JDK installation** is already there and you have the latest version of java installed
