# Introduction {#introduction}

Appium is an Open Source tool for testing native or hybrid mobile apps. It uses WebDriver JSON Wire protocol to drive both iOS and Android apps.

# **Why this book ?** {#why-this-book-}

There is a decent documentation on the Appium site but somewhere it lacked to produce a step by step guide, which would help you get rolling from scratch. There are bits and pieces which are fairly technical in nature and dev centric.

This book is an effort in the direction of consolidating all the knowledge and resources around appium. It will help software developers and testers successfully use Appium to automate the Android application.

This book will take you through the journey of understanding appium. It would also help you understand how the different pieces come together to build a test automation framework for Android App testing.

**B**_**ook also contains lot of code snippets which will help you in your daily automation stuff to get you started with Appium and Java.**_
